This is an experimental version of rock fragmentation web app. 
For the mean time the app only takes in 7 input parameters. 
Functional sections of the app include: 
home: where you can check your dates and write some notes for the blasting operation 
Data statistics: where you can check the data distribution, data correlation 
Prediction models: where you can choose one of the three models to predict for you after entering input parameters. 
Model performance: where you can check the performance of the model through statistical metrics and regression plots. 

In the future version of the app, clients will be able to analyse the results. 

Thank you!
